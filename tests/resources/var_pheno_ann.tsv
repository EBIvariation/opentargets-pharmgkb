The *58:01 allele was more common in those with allopurinol-induced cADRs, SCARs and MPE than in allopurinol-tolerant patients. Significant results were also seen when SJS, SJS/TEN, DRESS and SJS/TEN-DRESS were considered individually. The study also conducted meta-analyses comparing the frequency of *58:01 in those with allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN (10 studies), DRESS (7 studies) and MPE (6 studies) as compared to those in the general population. Significant results were seen for SJS/TEN and DRESS, and borderline significant in MPE. This study also looked at the gene dosage effect of *58:01, and found that homozygotes had a higher risk of cADRs as compared to heterozygotes. Finally, the study found that the combination of severe renal impairment (EGFR<30 mL/min/1.72m2) and *58:01 (either heterozygous or homozygous) greatly increased the risk for experiencing a cADR.
