    "* How many so-called \"alleles\" are actually these metabolyzer terms?\n",
    "    * might inform whether we need to associate via something other than allele, if many important annotations fall under this category\n",
    "* Do we have to manage contradictory information for a single clinical annotation or even for a single allele/genotype?\n",
    "    * i.e. one study says genotype AA increases X, another says it decreases X, another says it decreases some other Y...\n",
    "    * maybe also check whether this occurs in level 1/2 evidence especially\n",
    "    * informs data structure - i.e. do fields need to be lists or strings\n",
    "* How do multiple phenotypes, genes and drugs at the variant annotation level get aggregated at the clinical annotation level?\n",
    "    * [981755803](https://www.pharmgkb.org/clinicalAnnotation/981755803) indicates they do _not_ include all \"phenotype\" and \"population phenotype\" for all variant annotations at the clinical annotation level\n",
    "    * similarly interested in how they derive the clinical annotation sentence from all the variant annotation sentences, though it's arguably not important for our automated processing\n",
    " \n",
    "I also think there are at least 2 additional issues (not relating to direction of effect) that we can explore using these variant annotation tables, namely:\n",
    "* Using the \"and/or\" column to clearly delineate drug combinations vs. drugs that are just being annotated together\n",
    "* Using the additional phenotype annotations (side effect etc.) to disambiguate or supplement the phenotype information we use from the clinical annotation"
